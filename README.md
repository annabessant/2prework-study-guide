## Description

The purpose of this project was to familiarise myself with the language and tools I will need to work as a coder/web designer

I want to do this in order to learn new skills which I can deploy both for my own projects and for helping other people by building websites for them
I've been building the Prework guide as a way of organizing my learning jounrey as I prepare for the bootcamp
It helps me because it provides a reference guide; i can look back and review my prorgess and remember some of the obstacles I encountered
What I learnt during this project? - the little things matter, it;'s so easy to make a tiny mistake in coding and then spend a long time tryign to find the error. Debugging is a long process - but it helps to have someone else work through with you



## Installation

n/a

## Usage
The key initial steps to this project were around installing key software to enable me to work locally and then to upload/downlaod via GitHub so I developed experience with different environments.  It took a while to learn the different features of 'Terminal', VS Code, and GitHub but gradually I have developed a facility and now use them with a degree of confidence.

The project now has useful notes on some of the key tools like HTML, CSS and Javascript which can be referred to via the repo.



## Credits
